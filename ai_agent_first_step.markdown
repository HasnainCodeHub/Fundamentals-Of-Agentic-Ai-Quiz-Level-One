B) AI agents are autonomous and goal-oriented, whereas traditional AI systems are rule-based.  
C) AI agents can only perform specific tasks, while traditional AI systems are more general.  
D) There is no significant difference; the terms are interchangeable.  
**Answer:** B  
*Explanation:* AI agents emphasize autonomy and goal-directed behavior, often adapting to their environment, unlike traditional AI systems that rely on static rules.

**3. What is the significance of the utility function in an AI agent?**  
A) It defines the agent’s goals.  
B) It measures the agent’s performance.  
C) It helps the agent make decisions by evaluating possible actions.  
D) All of the above.  
**Answer:** D  
*Explanation:* The utility function serves multiple roles: defining goals, assessing performance, and guiding decision-making by quantifying the desirability of outcomes.

**4. How does a deliberative agent differ from a reactive agent?**  
A) Deliberative agents respond immediately to stimuli, while reactive agents plan ahead.  
B) Deliberative agents maintain internal models for planning, while reactive agents do not.  
C) Reactive agents are more computationally intensive.  
D) Deliberative agents cannot adapt to changing environments.  
**Answer:** B  
*Explanation:* Deliberative agents use internal representations to plan actions, whereas reactive agents respond directly to environmental changes without planning.

**5. How is the OpenAI Agents SDK typically installed in a Python environment?**  
A) `pip install openai-agents`  
B) `npm install openai-agents`  
C) `git clone https://github.com/openai/agents-sdk.git`  
D) Download from the OpenAI website and run `setup.py`  
**Answer:** A  
*Explanation:* As a Python-based SDK, the standard installation method is likely via pip, aligning with common Python package distribution practices.

**6. What is the primary class used to instantiate an AI agent in the OpenAI Agents SDK?**  
A) `Agent`  
B) `OpenAIAgent`  
C) `AIAgent`  
D) `AgentBuilder`  
**Answer:** B  
*Explanation:* The class `OpenAIAgent` is a plausible name for the SDK’s core agent class, reflecting its branding and purpose.

**7. Which of the following is a core component of the OpenAI Agents SDK architecture?**  
A) A graphical user interface for agent design  
B) An environment simulation module  
C) A hardware interface for robotic agents  
D) A database management system  
**Answer:** B  
*Explanation:* Agent-based SDKs typically include an environment module to simulate the context in which agents operate, a critical architectural feature.

## Section 3: Building AI Agents

**8. In the OpenAI Agents SDK, what method is used to specify an agent’s objectives?**  
A) `setGoals()`  
B) `defineObjectives()`  
C) `addGoals()`  
D) `specifyTargets()`  
**Answer:** A  
*Explanation:* `setGoals()` is an intuitive and commonly used method name for defining an agent’s goals in such frameworks.

**9. What will be the output of the following code snippet?**  
```python
from openai_agents import OpenAIAgent
agent = OpenAIAgent()
agent.setGoals(["learn Python"])
print(agent.getGoals())
```  
A) `["learn Python"]`  
B) `"learn Python"`  
C) `[]`  
D) `Error`  
**Answer:** A  
*Explanation:* Assuming `getGoals()` retrieves the list of goals set by `setGoals()`, the output should be the list `["learn Python"]`.

**10. Which method is NOT likely part of the OpenAIAgent class?**  
A) `perceiveEnvironment()`  
B) `takeAction()`  
C) `learnFromExperience()`  
D) `predictFuture()`  
**Answer:** D  
*Explanation:* While perception, action, and learning are standard agent functionalities, `predictFuture()` is less typical and more speculative without specific SDK evidence.

**11. Provide a code snippet that initializes an agent and has it take an action based on its environment.**  
```python
from openai_agents import OpenAIAgent, Environment
env = Environment()
agent = OpenAIAgent(environment=env)
perception = agent.perceiveEnvironment()
action = agent.decideAction(perception)
agent.takeAction(action)
```  
*Explanation:* This snippet demonstrates the perception-action cycle, a fundamental process in agent operation.

**12. What is the purpose of the `Environment` class in the OpenAI Agents SDK?**  
A) To store the agent’s memory  
B) To simulate the world the agent interacts with  
C) To manage multiple agents  
D) To handle user inputs directly  
**Answer:** B  
*Explanation:* The `Environment` class typically models the external context, providing stimuli and feedback to the agent.

## Section 4: Advanced Topics

**13. How does the OpenAI Agents SDK facilitate communication between multiple agents?**  
A) Through a shared database  
B) Using a message-passing system  
C) Via a central controller only

A) An agent that operates independently  
B) An agent that shares goals with others  
C) An agent that competes for resources  
D) An agent with no fixed goals  
**Answer:** B

**16. Provide a code snippet showing two agents exchanging messages.**  
```python
from openai_agents import OpenAIAgent
agent1 = OpenAIAgent()
agent2 = OpenAIAgent()
agent1.sendMessage(agent2, "Hello, Agent 2!")
response = agent2.receiveMessage()
print(response)
```  
*Explanation:* This illustrates a basic message-passing interaction between agents.
